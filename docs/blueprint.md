## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Cyberpunk purple (#BE29EC) to reflect the cybernetic aesthetic.
- Background color: Dark grey (#2B2D31) provides a stark contrast, while retaining hue.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#4EE2EC) will guide the users attention and reinforce the theme.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and short information displays; 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer displays and blocks of text. This pairing balances technical precision and clean legibility.
- Use sleek, neon-outlined icons for shortcuts and widgets to enhance the cyberpunk theme.
- Implement a layered layout with frosted glass effects, subtle shadows, and rounded corners to mimic macOS 26's liquid glass design.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations for day/night mode toggle and other UI elements to enhance user experience.
